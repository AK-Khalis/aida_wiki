## Luum Devices Overview

Luum devices come in different configurations based on the number of ports they support: 8, 24, and 48 ports. Each port on a Luum device has two channels, which can be individually controlled through the Aida application. Additionally, Luum devices include switches and sensors as inputs, further expanding their utility in various scenarios.

### Key Features:
- **Port and Channel Management:** Control each channel independently using the Aida application.
- **Input Integration:** Utilize switches and sensors as inputs for more dynamic control setups.
