## Introduction
Shade management is a critical component in Aida, allowing users to integrate, control, and automate shades for optimal performance. Traditionally, adding individual shades and mapping them to clusters has been a tedious and time-consuming process, especially when dealing with a large number of shades. To streamline this process, the Shade Pull Schedule feature was introduced. This feature simplifies the addition of multiple shades by enabling bulk uploads through an Excel template, significantly reducing setup time and effort.

This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the Shade Pull Schedule feature, from downloading the template to monitoring the status of scheduled shades. By the end of this guide, users will be well-equipped to leverage this functionality to manage their shades effectively and efficiently.
